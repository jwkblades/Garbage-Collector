Garbage-Collector Program

Our team's proposed project is to create a web-based side-scroller game, tentatively called "Garbage Collector", where the player battles zombie children, fork bombs, and memory leaks to prevent having memory and cpu overloaded. We'll probably be using HTML5 and Javascript for the majority of the code.
